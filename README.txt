INFOTOOLS

What is/are infotools you ask???

This app is a collection of custom commands that let you see information from the search head that may normally require access to a command shell or file system.

In version 1.0 there are 10 custom commands:

| lookupinfo

| bundleinfo

| userinfo

| btoolinfo 

| artifactinfo

| pinginfo 

| sslinfo 

| varinfo

| cliinfo

| specinfo

Each of these commands is a generating command (must be first command in the pipeline) and return results about the file objects.

What is the use case for infotools?

Glad you asked...

In Splunk Cloud and with many on-premise deployments most users do not have access to the file system.
It can be very useful to be able to see details about some specific Splunk files to help with troubleshooting.

For example:

One of the most common problems in many environments is large lookups file affecting bundle replication
the restapi commands for lookups do not return information about the file size if the lookup is not defined in transforms.conf, so you need access to the file system to see this information

In a search head cluster, large lookups that are frequently updated can impact performance since the entire file is replicated to all members
since lookupinfo provides the modtime, you can see if a lookup has been recently updated
